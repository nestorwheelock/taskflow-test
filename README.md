# TaskFlow Personal Productivity API

A test project demonstrating enhanced Claude Code configuration with Test-Driven Development, iterative cycles, and professional git workflow.

## Enhanced Claude Configuration

This project validates a comprehensive enhanced Claude configuration featuring:

- **23-Step Iterative Development Cycle** with mandatory quality gates
- **Scope Discipline Guardrails** preventing feature creep and ensuring planning adherence
- **Test-Driven Development** with >95% coverage requirements
- **Professional Git Workflow** with conventional commits and documentation
- **Mandatory Task Creation Protocol** for all user suggestions
- **Sprint Discipline Protocol** ensuring completion before new planning

**📋 Configuration Status**: ✅ **FULLY VALIDATED FOR PRODUCTION USE**

### Key Results Achieved
- **30 tests passing** with comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Scope discipline validated** - correctly rejected premature testing requests
- **Complete 23-step cycle execution** demonstrated with T-001 Task 3
- **Professional git workflow** with conventional commits and documentation
- **Planning methodology enforced** with user stories and task breakdowns
- **Sprint completion protocol** enforced - finish current work before new planning

### Documentation
- **[Complete Configuration Guide](docs/CLAUDE_CONFIGURATION.md)** - Detailed methodology and implementation
- **[Planning Documents](planning/)** - User stories, tasks, and acceptance criteria
- **[Test Results](backend/users/tests/)** - Comprehensive test suites demonstrating TDD approach

### Configuration Features Demonstrated
- ✅ Automatic planning validation before any implementation
- ✅ Test-first development with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Scope creep prevention with proper rejection responses
- ✅ Quality gates at every phase of development
- ✅ Professional documentation and git workflow
- ✅ Mandatory task creation for all user suggestions
- ✅ Sprint discipline - complete current work before new planning

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (Sprint 1)
- **T-001 Task 1-2**: User model with email authentication
- **T-001 Task 3**: Authentication serializers with validation
- **T-002**: Claude configuration documentation

### 🔄 Current Sprint Remaining
- **T-001 Task 4**: Authentication Views & REST API Endpoints
- **T-001 Task 5**: JWT Configuration & Security Middleware
- **T-001 Task 7**: API Documentation & Error Handling

### 📋 Next Sprint (Backlog)
- Login functionality testing (requires T-001 completion)
- Additional user stories (S-002, S-003)

## Enhanced Configuration Validation

This project successfully demonstrates the enhanced Claude configuration prevents:

### ❌ **Scope Creep Prevention**
**Test Scenario**: User requested login testing before API endpoints existed
**Result**: Configuration correctly rejected with proper explanation and planning reference

### ✅ **Sprint Discipline Enforcement**
**Test Scenario**: New feature suggestions during active sprint
**Result**: Tasks created and documented but not started until sprint completion

### ✅ **23-Step Iterative Cycle**
**Test Scenario**: T-001 Task 3 implementation
**Result**: Complete execution of all phases with quality gates and testing

### ✅ **Professional Standards**
- Django best practices with comprehensive testing
- Conventional git commits with technical detail
- Complete documentation with every implementation
- Security compliance (no AI attribution)

## Getting Started

1. **Review Configuration**: Read [Configuration Guide](docs/CLAUDE_CONFIGURATION.md)
2. **Examine Planning**: Review user stories in [planning/stories/](planning/stories/)
3. **Study Implementation**: Check test-driven approach in [backend/users/tests/](backend/users/tests/)
4. **Follow Methodology**: Use planning templates for new features

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test users

# Results: 30 tests passing
# - 7 model tests (basic functionality)
# - 8 edge case tests (validation scenarios)
# - 15 serializer tests (comprehensive validation)
```

## Configuration Benefits

- **Quality Assurance**: No implementation without comprehensive testing
- **Project Discipline**: Prevents scope creep and ensures planning adherence
- **Professional Standards**: Enterprise-grade development workflow suitable for teams
- **Sprint Management**: Enforces completion of commitments before new planning

This enhanced Claude configuration is ready for production use in projects requiring high quality standards and professional development practices.
